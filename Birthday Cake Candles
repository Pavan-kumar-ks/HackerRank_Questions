You are in charge of the cake for a child's birthday.
You have decided the cake will have one candle for each year of their total age. 
They will only be able to blow out the tallest of the candles.
Count how many candles are tallest.

Here is the solution which I used to solve the below question:

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int i,n,max =0;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    int a[n];
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        scanf("%d",&a[i]);
        if(max<a[i])//if the max value is less than array index then the value of the respective index is stored in the max.
        {
            max = a[i];
        }
    }
    int count=0;
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        if(a[i]== max)//as the stored value of max is equal to array element then the count is increased the many times the value is stored again and again.
        {
            count++;
        }
    }
    printf("%d",count);
    return 0;
}

Hope this helps :)
