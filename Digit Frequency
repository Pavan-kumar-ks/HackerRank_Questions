Given a string,s , consisting of alphabets and digits, find the frequency of each digit in the given string.

Constraints:
1<= len(num) <=1000

I was given a string which contains alphabets and numbers . 
I need to print how many times a number has repeated in the given string.
So for this I need to take the input string first.
I need to iterate loop till the string length.
I need to check if the first character is between strings 0 and 9.
If it is true , then inside the condition I should convert that string to integer.
Then that character which was converted to integer should be stored in integer array.
Then I print the newly stored values of integer array.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {

    int i=0,j,b[10]={0};
    char num[1000];
    scanf("%s",num);
    for(i=0;i<strlen(num);i++)//iterates until the given string lenght reaches end 
    {
        if(num[i]>='0' && num[i]<='9')//checks wheather the given digit ascii value is greater than 0 and less than 9
        {
            int a;
            a = num[i] - '0';
            b[a]++;
            a = num[i] - '0': This subtracts the character code of '0' from the character code of num[i]. For example, a = 55 - 48 = 7.
            b[a]++;: This increments the element in the b array at the index corresponding to the extracted digit (a). Since a is 7, b[7] is incremented by 1.
        }
    }
    for(i=0;i<10;i++)
    {
        printf("%d ",b[i]);//prints the respective repetations for each digit .Like for b[0] the number of iteration is 5 this was stored from the loop.
    }
    
    return 0;
}

Hope this helps :)
