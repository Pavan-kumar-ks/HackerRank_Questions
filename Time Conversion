Problem statment is as follows:

Given a time in 12-hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.

Note: - 12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock is 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
- 12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock is 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.

Constraints:

All input times are valid

The logic which I used is as followa:

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<string.h>
int main()
{
    char t[10];
    scanf("%s",t);
    if(t[8]=='P')
    {
      if(t[0] != '1' || t[1]!= '2')
      {
          t[0]++;
          t[1] += 2;
      }
    }  
    else
    {
        if(t[0]=='1' && t[1]=='2')
        {
            t[0]=t[1]='0';
        }
    }
    t[8]='\0';
    printf("%s",t);
    
    return 0;
}

Hope this helps:)
