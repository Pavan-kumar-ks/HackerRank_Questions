The problem statment is as follows :

An array is a type of data structure that stores elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory.
In an array,A,of size N,each memory location has some unique index,i(where0<=i<N),that can be referenced as A[i] orAi .
Reverse an array of integers.

The solution is as follows:

I have used dynamic memory allocation for array.

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
int main()
{
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    int *p;
    p = (int*)malloc(n*sizeof(int));
    int i;
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        scanf("%d",(p+i));
    }
    for(i=n-1;i>=0;i--)
    {
        printf("%d ",*(p+i));
    }
    return 0;
}

Hope this helps :)
