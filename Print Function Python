The included code stub will read an integer,n, from STDIN.

Without using any string methods, try to print the following:

123...n

Note that "..." represents the consecutive values in between.

Below is the code which I implemented to solve this question:

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    i = 1
    for i in range(n):
        i = i+1
        print(i,end="")
In the above code the integer type is only printed but at the last I have included end=""which prints the value of the loop in the same line.

Hope this helps :)
