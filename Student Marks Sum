In this question I was asked to create a function which conatins three parameters , a pointer variable named marks , variable named number_of_students and variable gender.
A dynamic array was created and the marks was stored in that dynamic array . 
A function was asked to build a logic in which when the user inputs the parameter as boy the function should add alternative even indexes and return the result.
In the same way when the user inputs the parameter as girl the alternative odd indexes were added and retured the result.

Below is the code which I developed to solve this question:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

//Complete the following function.

int marks_summation(int* marks, int number_of_students, char gender) 
{
    int sum1 = 0;
    
    for(int i = 0;i<number_of_students;i = i+2)
    {
        sum1 = sum1 + *(marks+i);
    }
    int sum2 = 0;
    for(int j = 1;j<number_of_students; j = j+2)
    {
        sum2 = sum2 + *(marks+j);  
    }
    if(gender=='b')
    return sum1;
    else 
    return sum2;
    
}

int main() {
    int number_of_students;
    char gender;
    int sum;
  
    scanf("%d", &number_of_students);
    int *marks = (int *) malloc(number_of_students * sizeof (int));
 
    for (int student = 0; student < number_of_students; student++) {
        scanf("%d", (marks + student));
    }
    
    scanf(" %c", &gender);
    sum = marks_summation(marks, number_of_students, gender);
    printf("%d", sum);
    free(marks);
 
    return 0;
}




Hope this helps :)
