HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.
Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.
Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:

If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

Below is the logic which I used to solve this problem.

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<math.h>
int main()
{
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    int i,grade;
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        scanf("%d",&grade);
    
        if(grade<38)
        {
            printf("%d\n",grade);
        }
        else if(5-(grade%5)<3)
        {
            printf("%d\n",5*(grade/5 +1));
        }
        else {
            printf("%d\n",grade);
        }
    }
    
    return 0;
}
Hope this helps :)
