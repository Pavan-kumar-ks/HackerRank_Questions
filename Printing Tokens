The problem statment is given as :
Given a sentence,s, print each word of the sentence in a new line.

Constraints:
1<= len(s) <=1000

The string which is given as input is stored dynamically.I was asked to print the text in the next line after every word. 
Below is the logic I used to solve this problem.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {

    char *s;
    s = malloc(1024 * sizeof(char));
    scanf("%[^\n]", s);
    s = realloc(s, strlen(s) + 1);
    int n = strlen(s); // calculates the length of the string and stores it's value in n.
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        printf("%c",s[i]);// Prints the characters
        if(s[i] == ' ')// Checks if the cursor encounters a blank space it executes the condition.
        {
            printf("\n");//Prints a new line character

        }
    continue;//Makes the loop to iterate again once the condition is checked.
    }
    return 0;
}

Hope this helps :)
